\begin{itemize}
    \item Loewner with noise
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In most data collection, there is error. In our experiments, noise \(\implies\) large error. Error correction techniques may be necessary to develop.
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    \item Generalized eigenvalue problem and error spikes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Closely related to the first problem. With noise, the eigenvalues shift closer to the imaginary axis, causing problems. As a result the Loewner matrices become singular.
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    \item Performace optimization (Loewner Method)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It would be interesting to explore optimal selection of frequencies and other related factors that could influence results.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
