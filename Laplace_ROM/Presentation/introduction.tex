\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Problem}
Given\\
\bigskip
$\bA, {\bf E} \in \real^{n \times n}$, ${\bf B} \in \real^{n \times m}$, ${\bf C} \in \real^{k \times n}$, and ${\bf D} \in \real^{k \times m}$\\
\bigskip
consider a system with $m$ inputs and $k$ outputs of the type:
\begin{align*}
            {\bf E}\frac{d}{dt} {\bf y}(t)  &= \bA {\bf y}(t) + {\bf B}{\bf u}(t)\\
            {\bf z}(t) &= {\bf C} {\bf y}(t) + {\bf D}{\bf u}(t)
\end{align*}

with n large (\(>1000\)). !!Expensive to solve!!
\bigskip

Goal - Create a reduced order model\\
\bigskip
$\widehat \bA, {\bf \widehat E} \in \real^{r \times r}$, ${\bf \widehat B} \in \real^{r \times m}$, ${\bf \widehat C} \in \real^{k \times r}$, and ${\bf \widehat D} \in \real^{k \times m}$\\
\bigskip
with r small (\(<20\)) that approximates the original model

\begin{frame}{Example Problem: Average Room Temp.}

Imagine being in charge of writing code to run a thermostat. You'd like to keep a room at a set average temperature.\\
\bigskip
Some problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dynamical system is 3D, making the model size very large
    \item You only care about the average temperature of the room
    \item The model is too large to run efficiently on a tiny chip
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
With model reduction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model size is small
    \item Can be run quickly on a small chip
    \item No excess information
    \item Model still is accurate enough for effective use
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Reduced Order Model Techniques}

Our research focuses on:
\bigskip
    \begin{itemize}
        \item <1-> Interpolatory techniques
        \begin{itemize}
            \item <1-> Projection Based
            \item <1-> Loewner Method
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip
    Each technique will require working in frequency space.\\
    \bigskip
    To operate in frequency space, we must apply the Laplace Transform to the time-dependent system.
